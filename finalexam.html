    <p1> Babbu Maan recorded his first album Sajjan Rumaal De Geya in 1997[1] but revised and re-released most of the songs in his subsequent albums. Maan's first official debut album Tu Meri Miss India was released in 1999.[3][4]

In 2001, Babbu Maan released his third album Saaun Di Jhadi,[4][5] featuring songs such as Chan Chanani, Raat Guzarlayi, Dil Ta Pagal Hai, Ishq, Kabza and Touch Wood, and in 2003, he wrote and sang for his first film soundtrack Hawayein where he worked alongside Indian playback singers Sukhwinder Singh and Jaspinder Narula. Maan released his fourth album Ohi Chann Ohi Rataan in 2004, followed by Pyaas in 2005, a best-selling Punjabi album of the time.[6] In 2007, Maan released his first Hindi album entitled Mera Gham, and in 2009, his first religious album Singh Better Than King.[6] A song from the latter, Baba Nanak, a reaction to fake saints and preachers in Punjab, caused various debates about the growing phenomenon in the state.[7] On 4 July 2013, Maan released Talaash: In Search Of Soul, his first Punjabi commercial album after eight years.[6][8] In 2015, the album named Itihaas was released and in 2018 Ik C Pagal was released</p1>
